Programming Language: Java
Development Environment: Visual Studio
Eye Tracking Software: Integration with external eye-tracking devices for gaze data.
TUIO Technology: Utilized for product identification and interaction tracking.
System Architecture
Queue Management Module:

Manages the checkout queue system by identifying when shoppers join and organizing the queue accordingly.
Optimizes waiting times and ensures fair processing order.
Eye-Tracking Module:

Detects and records the shopper’s eye gaze to identify which products attract the most attention.
Analyzes gaze patterns to identify the most preferred products of each user.

Displays real-time offers on digital signage or mobile devices as the customer navigates the store.
TUIO Product Identification:

Uses TUIO to track and identify products in the store.
Automatically logs product interactions as the customer selects or investigates items.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have the latest version of Java installed.

Download from Oracle.
Visual Studio: You need Visual Studio IDE with Java extensions.

Download from Visual Studio.
Eye Tracking SDK: Install the software development kit (SDK) for the eye-tracking hardware you are using.

E.g., Tobii or EyeLink SDK.
TUIO Library: The project relies on the TUIO protocol for product identification.

Download the TUIO Java library from TUIO.org.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/supermarket-assistant-system.git
cd supermarket-assistant-system
Open the project in Visual Studio:

Open the cloned directory in Visual Studio.
Make sure the necessary Java extensions are installed.
Install dependencies:

Add the required TUIO and Eye Tracking SDK libraries to your project.
Configure the Eye Tracking hardware:

Follow the eye tracking device setup guide.
Ensure the SDK is properly integrated with the project.
Running the Application
Launch the application from Visual Studio by running the main Java class.
The system will start tracking shoppers in real-time and will display a queue management dashboard.
Eye tracking data will be captured and stored, while promotions and offers will be displayed on digital signage or a connected device.
